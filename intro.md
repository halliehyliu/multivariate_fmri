## Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Data
  fMRI is a brain imaging technique that measures and maps brain activity by tracking oxygen consumption. fMRI measures blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals in the brain, based on the theory that active brain areas consume more oxygen than inactive areas. During an experiment, subjects commonly perform a set of tasks in the scanner, while a series of brain images are acquired throughout the course of the experiment. Task-related brain activation is then measured by the BOLD signal changes between these images. 
  fMRI data can be thought of as four-dimensional images, consisting of a sequence of three-dimensional brain volumes (spatial element) across a time series (temporal element). Similar to how a digital image is formed by a number of pixels, each brain volume in fMRI is made up of voxels - small, three-dimensional cubes. The spatial resolution of fMRI scans is determined by the size of these voxels, which are commonly 2 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm. At this spatial resolution, a single scan of a whole brain volume contains approximately  778,000 voxels. Each voxel’s position within the brain is represented using x, y, and z coordinates. The temporal resolution of fMRI data is defined by the repetition time (TR)—the time it takes to capture a complete brain volume. TR is usually set to two seconds. 
  The basic unit of time within a time series of an fMRI scan is repetition time (TR), which is the time it takes to obtain a whole-brain volume, and is typically set at two seconds. During an fMRI scan, neural activity is measured across the time series for each voxel. For example, in a 30-minute experiment with a TR of two seconds, a BOLD value is recorded for all 778,000 voxels every two seconds. This process generates 900 whole-brain volumes and approximately 700 million individual BOLD responses. The massive amount of fMRI data makes it very difficult to analyze. To add to the challenge, fMRI data is often noisy in nature, with noise coming from subjects’ head movement during scans, and from the magnet of the fMRI scanner itself.
